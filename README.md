# React-2-Expensify
Expensify App from the second half of [The Complete React Web Developer Course 
(2nd Edition) by Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/learn/v4/content)

## Progress

Completed section 11 - Redux

## Differences from Andrew

I haven't done the Portfolio app, destructuring, HOC, or some of the redux examples.

I have some minimal CSS until Andrew styles it in section 17.

## Git client

I have used Git at the command-line for 10 years.
Over that time, I have tried many different graphical shells for Git,
without finding one that was easier and nicer to use than the command-line
(in my view).

I have now found that [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) is an excellent
Git shell and would advise using it to everyone.
